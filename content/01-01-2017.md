## **`Let me start of by saying writing is not my forte. I can do a bunch of things but when it comes to writing, I feel like I can never find the perfect way of communicating what I want to say. But hey maybe, this is a good time for me to learn how to do it, so here I go!I went to my first meet up two years ago and it was hosted by one of my friends that happened to be a developer, I was looking for a career change at that time and though I would give it a try.First meet up I went I meat a bunch of developer the culture and community aspect of it is great in fact I think that is why I am here today, and since I have created some meaning relationships with some people that consistently help me evolve in my journey of become a developer.The road is certainly not easy but it is certainly easier because of the resources that are out there, and if you are reading this blog at the bottom I will add some links for you.`**
